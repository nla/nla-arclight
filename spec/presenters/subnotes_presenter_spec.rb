In 1916 he joined the marine service of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) (AWA) as a wireless operator. After five years at sea, he was appointed to AWA's experimental wireless station at Koo-Wee-Rup in Victoria. When that station closed down in 1922, Bearup acted as AWA's Melbourne inspector. In 1923 he travelled to England where he continued to be involved in radio. Upon his return to Australia, he joined the Australian Broadcasting Company and was appointed Studio Manager of the Melbourne radio station, 3LO. In 1929, Bearup became Victorian Manager, a position he retained when the Australian Broadcasting Commission was established in 1932. Bearup's association with the ABC was to last thirty years. In 1936, he spent nine months overseas investigating the broadcasting scene in the United States and Great Britain. From 1937 to 1945, he served the ABC as Assistant General Manager and he was also Acting General Manager from 1940 to 1943 and in 1945. In 1946, Bearup was posted to London as the ABC's Overseas Representative and he held this position until his retirement from the ABC in 1962. As part of his duties he also visited the United States during this period. Bearup was Chairman of radio station 5DN (Adelaide) and a director of the Macquarie Broadcasting Services from 1964 to 1976.\",\"Bearup was also a Freeman and Liveryman of the Worshipful Company of Musicians of the City of London, a life member of the Radio Institute of Radio Engineers (U.S.) and, for 47 years, he was a member of Rotary clubs in Melbourne, Sydney, London and Adelaide. This long service was recognised when he was awarded the Paul Harris Fellowship just before his death. In 1925, he married Dorothy Watson and they had two daughters, Judith and Cecilie. Bearup's wife died in 1979 and he died a year later, at his home in the Adelaide suburb of Belair, on 15 June 1980, aged 82.\",{\"bibref\":[\"<em>Who's who in Australia</em>, 1977.\",\"Melbourne <em>Herald</em> and <em>Weekly Times</em>, 1977.\"]}]}"
